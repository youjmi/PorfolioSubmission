# PorfolioSubmission

Welcome to my Portfolio Webpage where I share with you a little bit about me, and some projects that I am proud of, and my Resume. 

 When you first click on my deployed link :https://youjmi.github.io/PorfolioSubmission/ , it will take you to the main page or the index. From there you will be able to guide yourself to the appropriate links on my NabvBar and my Social Media links in the footer.

 When you click on the Portfolio link, it will open to a page showing you three of my works that I am most proud of.

Each of my works have an option to view my Github code and an option to view my deployed WebPages where the user will be able to interact with what I have created. From left to right, I present my most recent accomplishment, my first Project! 

Ace of Pentacles is our first project that we have successfully created. We think it is completely original and complex. This project is a Horoscrope/Tart Card Reading website with various JS equations that help us randomize 70+ different cards.

The third work is my Daily Calendar. It is color coded by matching the Hour of the Day and you are able to save inputs to Local Storage. This was my first experience with working with Local Storage.
