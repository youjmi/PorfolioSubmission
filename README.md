## Description
Welcome to my Portfolio Webpage where I share with you a little bit about me, and some projects that I am proud of, and my Resume. 

 When you first click on my deployed link :https://youjmi.github.io/PorfolioSubmission/ , it will take you to the main page or the index. From there you will be able to guide yourself to the appropriate links on my NabvBar and my Social Media links in the footer.

 When you click on the Portfolio link, it will open to a page showing you three of my works that I am most proud of.

## Usage

Each of my works have an option to view my Github code and an option to view my deployed WebPages where the user will be able to interact with what I have created. From left to right, I present my most recent accomplishment, my first Project! 

Ace of Pentacles is our first project that we have successfully created. We think it is completely original and complex. This project is a Horoscrope/Tart Card Reading website with various JS equations that help us randomize 70+ different cards. 

Project 1: Ace of Pentacles: https://youjmi.github.io/AceOfPentacles/

The second work is my Random Password Generator which was my first assignment that I am most proud of!

The third work is my Daily Calendar. It is color coded by matching the Hour of the Day and you are able to save inputs to Local Storage. This was my first experience with working with Local Storage.

The fourth work is my Employee Tracker. I have created and built a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. This is accessible with node.

The fifth work is my Employee Engine Generator, or a software engineering team generator. With this application, you will be able to navigate with ease and built your Team into an automatically generated html file.

The sixth work is my Burger Logger Application. It is my most recent one that I have completed! I have created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. I have followed the MVC design pattern; using Node and MySQL to query and routing data in my app, and Handlebars to generate my HTML.
Here is my Heroku link: https://yjk-burgerapp.herokuapp.com/

Lastly, the Resume Link will direct you to a different page presenting to you my most up to date Resume.

## Installation

A few of my works are deployed links where the user is able to play around with the website, but my last 3 works require installing some very important dependencies that require these backend applications to run. 

To begin, I had to install the following:

I created a package.json by running the following on the command line:
```
npm init
```

Varying between the 3 different applications, I have installed the following packages that were essential in their own way:

```
npm install express
npm install express-handlebars
npm install mysql
npm i console.table --save
npm i inquirer --save
```

Then application will be invoked by using the following command:

```
nodemon <js filename> OR node <js filename>
```
